Since NeurotechX is a bootstrapped non-profit, we are unable to pay for the premium version of Slack and therefore all messages after 10,000 are deleted. We have built a temporary solution by archiving all of the text onto our Github page. You can visit the list of archived text here. We only track public channels.

Finally take a look at the different chapters that exist in NeuroTechX. You may discover that there is a local community for you to get connected to.  All city chapter channels have a “_” at the beginning of it.

To find a *list of cities* where we are located in, please visit http://neurotechx.com/ and see if there is a chapter near you!

If you'd like to get involved, now is the time! Have a look at our 2017 Committees at : http://neurotechx.com/opportunities/index.html.
