We'd like for the different NTX chapters to have access to it and do an event to showcase what's new in the field. From "wow" kinda news to scientific breakthroughs, to new kickstarters, to new laws, to major investments, etc.

> 
The goal of the presentation (and the event) is that when you leave, you feel like you have the big picture of what happened lately - without digging too much into the science of it, but staying at a higher level. 

> 
And obviously you'd leave inspired, because the field is awesome :stuck_out_tongue:

> 


> 
1) Do you know any review already online that could be useful?

> 
2) What would you put in that review/presentation? (what for you, is worth mentioning that happened in 2016)

> 
3) If you'd like to help with the content and/or the presentation, please PM me :slightly_smiling_face:

> 
Feel free to throw anything that comes to mind!

(obviously the presentation will be accessible/shared)

 >Hi there! My name is Alaina Finley and I am currently an undergrad student pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Utah. This past summer I worked as an intern for Push the World in NYC ( aj ) I definitively want to go into the NeuroTech industry as neuroscience is my passion, however with the courses Im taking in CS, Im only exposed to neuroscience via independently reading research papers. (Im going into CS so I can eventually go into neurotech..and Im really feeling disconnected to the field) My school offers a create your own degree program that I know many kids have gone through and have had success, and I was thinking of switching and doing an Applied Neuroscience degree with an emphasis in computing. I was wondering if anyone has any input in making this move? And any advice (especially to courses youd recommend I take)?

 >alainafinley: Hey alainafinley  The answer to your question will depend on what your interests are and what you want to specialize in. Neurotech is a multi disciplinary field and you can contribute to it in a variety of different ways. If you want to do research, ask yourself what element of Neuroscience you would like to get involved in. In the meantime, I'd suggest looking at some Neuroscience Moocs to compliment your CS studies and take a look at these resources: <https://github.com/NeuroTechX/awesome-bci> The one which may interest you the most is the analyzing neural time series book. I'd also suggest talking to dano  and see about contributing to the <#C0K883P71|interactive-tutorial>  project <https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/analyzing-neural-time-series-data>

Usually starts off with some introductory bio, chem, physics, psych, and then assorted advanced neuroscience courses, but it's dependent on the style of the degree and what you want to focus on.

Or non-invasive technology like EMG reading muscle activity allowing you to send commands to control 'something'.

3/29/2017 2:45 PM

 **karchie** :

 >there's risk in unsupported hype. around neurotech (interpreting the term very broadly), there are relatively easy problems (stimulating/reading anything peripheral) and moderately easy problems (deep brain stimulation), and then there's anything involving neocortex. with pyramidal cells, there's almost certainly semantic content not just to the coarse location and intensity of stimulation, but to the fine location (certainly apical vs. basal dendrites, maybe even at the level of individual branches) and the fine temporal structure; and these details will vary from one cell to the next. I've been hearing about cortical prosthetic modules (for a particularly egregious example) for 20 years; but if that's going to work at all, I think at best there's a period of months while the nearby neurons learn how to interface with this chunk of new stuff. That's without even getting into the biochemical problems like controlling inflammation and infection and creating a local chemical environment to promote plasticity. I mean, yes, march on with the rats, but I'll bet a nickel against any sort of cognitive upgrades in my lifetime. (sensory upgrades, sure, but noninvasive approaches work pretty well there.)

_"So its important to keep all of these considerations in mind when discussing Neuralink, Kernel, and the scores of brain-computer interface companies that will undoubtedly sprout up in their wake. Its fun to talk about fighting Skynet or preventing The Matrix, but Musk and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley do have more realistic concerns and are, at least right now, more open to admitting that the more near-term goal is combating diseases and funding neuroscience research. It doesnt grab headlines quite like combatting the extinction of the human race, but we should all rest easy knowing that were not quite there yet."_

PONG

> 
Theres a pattern thats common in neurotech: 

> 
Some enthusiastic engineers will discover EEG or tDCS, order a kit, and start making random things while caught up in the romance of neurohacking. 

> 


> 
There are a couple of common forms this initial exploration takes:

> 
1) A meditation app." "Well do neurofeedback to show people when theyre in a meditative state, and use that help them meditate more! Then more people will start meditating, and the world will become more conscious."

> 
This is the hello world of neurohacking. A good idea for your own education, but Interaxons Muse is already a highly optimized version of this product. <http://www.choosemuse.com/people-behind-muse/>

> 


> 
1b) A variant: Attention-tracking app. People will wear an EEG at their computers and it will tell them when their focused! 

> 
To  test whether people will actually use this, try offering a friend $20 to wear an EEG headset for six hours per day for one week. 

> 


> 
2) Control X with my brain. A mood-tracking LED shirt, a robot, your Spotify music playlist, a flamethrower, a drone. With motor imagery, you can use the brain as a up-down or left-right switch for any device. I wouldnt say dont do this. I would just say be aware youre doing this for your own education, in the way that freshman CS majors are often given homework to write their own version of Pong. Because of the benefit-intrusiveness tradeoff of consumer EEG headsets, basically no one will walk around with an EEG on their head in order to express their emotions through your cool LED shirt. Heck, most people wont consistently wear a fitness tracking bracelet (from which you can infer mood). (<http://insights.dice.com/2017/02/07/lessons-jawbone-failures/>). 

> 


> 
3) tDCS. "We heard on that one NPR episode that the army uses these to speed up learning. What if we could enhance learning?" Thats what Thync said in their original sales pitch. 

> 


> 
Consider the first generation (2005-2017+) of consumer EEG and tDCS devices. Much of their sales momentum came from the novelty of a brain-reading or a brain-zapping device. After consumers order them, most are not consistently used because they were a wiz-bang gadget to show at a party, or an exciting thing to hack on, rather than consistently solving a problem that people have. 

> 
<http://Foc.us|Foc.us> recently introduced a product line targeted at DIY hackers: <https://www.foc.us/eeg>. Out of all the potential markets they could target, its alarming that brain hacking enthusiast are the largest. 

> 


> 
If consumer neurotech wants to make really useful and commercially successful devices, we need to expand our technological toolkit.

 >stephen I agree with your post. One thing is that a lot of the solutions that you list would involve developing new technology, which is a solid step forward, but a hard problem for hobbyists and student clubs. Developing hardware takes decent funding and continued interest and investment from team members.

Beyond developing new technology, the other side is taking more advantage of the low-hanging fruit present with the *current technology*. Here are some recommendations for doing that:   

> 
- Read the literature! Scientists have been correlating various biosignals for decades and wrote about many things beyond motor imagery and meditation. A few examples are memory encoding, visual/auditory/sensory perception, emotion valence, various specific cognitive processing, etc.  It will also give you a sense of what the current limits of the field are. If scientists can't get motor imagery to work reliably (&gt;95% accuracy, which is roughly what would be needed for using an input device with low frustration) with 32 electrodes, then what's the chance of getting it to work with 4-8 electrodes? 

> 
- explore other avenues besides quantified self: things like diagnosis, drug detection, lie detection, "real" attention tracking for optimizing content, which involve using a device for a relatively short period of time, have been relatively underexplored in Neurotech, but are some of the areas where it has the most potential with the current tools

 >As an addendum to "read the literature", you can get a lot of mileage when getting started from replicating scientific papers using biosignals to measure the effect you're curious about.

 >Also, I think the current barrier to entry to all of this is that people don't know how to start recording &amp; processing biosignals, and don't have a good sense of the whole field. <#C3525BTBN|neurotechedu> should help out with both of these problems

 >Also, what are you talking about when saying "remix normal data science tools to create better workflows for dealing with neural data"? Any specific use cases in mind?

 >In terms of hardware specs, it's comparable to most eeg systems. The main limitation is you are stuck to those electrode locations. It is a pretty well designed eeg. ERP and Oscillations are both possible with the Muse headband. Someone was also able to do Frontal Assymetry as well with the headband (<https://imotions.com/blog/frontal-asymmetry-101-get-insights-motivation-emotions-eeg/>)

 >They also have a great SDK. I would just love to see more open source projects with it (There are a few, but I would love to see more)

 >Yeah, their SDK was a big motivation to buy the headset. What kind of OSS projects with Muse would you want to see? I'm interested in doing something with it now, but having a better understanding of what's possible will be great

 >Also, we are kind of stuck with writing smartphone apps for now due to the SDK mostly working on iOS and Android.

 >Thanks for the frontal asymmetry link! On challenge here is that there seems to be a lack of publicly available Muse datasets, so the first thing would be to make an app to record and store them for later analysis
