We'd like for the different NTX chapters to have access to it and do an event to showcase what's new in the field. From "wow" kinda news to scientific breakthroughs, to new kickstarters, to new laws, to major investments, etc.

> 
The goal of the presentation (and the event) is that when you leave, you feel like you have the big picture of what happened lately - without digging too much into the science of it, but staying at a higher level. 

> 
And obviously you'd leave inspired, because the field is awesome :stuck_out_tongue:

> 


> 
1) Do you know any review already online that could be useful?

> 
2) What would you put in that review/presentation? (what for you, is worth mentioning that happened in 2016)

> 
3) If you'd like to help with the content and/or the presentation, please PM me :slightly_smiling_face:

> 
Feel free to throw anything that comes to mind!

(obviously the presentation will be accessible/shared)

For those of you who arent familiar, Mindset is a pair of overear headphones that integrate EEG sensors into the band to measure and improve concentration. Theyre bluetooth, noise cancelling, and give you full access to the data. You can get more info at <http://thinkmindset.com|thinkmindset.com>, which will also redirect to the Kickstarter once its up.

The campaign goes live tomorrow at 8am EST. Be the first to grab one of the early birds, and get 46% off! :smile:

 >Hi there! My name is Alaina Finley and I am currently an undergrad student pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Utah. This past summer I worked as an intern for Push the World in NYC ( aj ) I definitively want to go into the NeuroTech industry as neuroscience is my passion, however with the courses Im taking in CS, Im only exposed to neuroscience via independently reading research papers. (Im going into CS so I can eventually go into neurotech..and Im really feeling disconnected to the field) My school offers a create your own degree program that I know many kids have gone through and have had success, and I was thinking of switching and doing an Applied Neuroscience degree with an emphasis in computing. I was wondering if anyone has any input in making this move? And any advice (especially to courses youd recommend I take)?

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >alainafinley: Hey alainafinley  The answer to your question will depend on what your interests are and what you want to specialize in. Neurotech is a multi disciplinary field and you can contribute to it in a variety of different ways. If you want to do research, ask yourself what element of Neuroscience you would like to get involved in. In the meantime, I'd suggest looking at some Neuroscience Moocs to compliment your CS studies and take a look at these resources: <https://github.com/NeuroTechX/awesome-bci> The one which may interest you the most is the analyzing neural time series book. I'd also suggest talking to dano  and see about contributing to the <#C0K883P71|interactive-tutorial>  project <https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/analyzing-neural-time-series-data>

 >hey alainafinley! in terms of putting together courses for a degree, you should check out the degree requirements for a neuroscience major at some undergraduate colleges, and see what classes they generally suggest (for example, i think Brown has a good program: <https://www.brown.edu/academics/neuroscience/undergraduate/neuroscience-concentration-requirements>). Usually starts off with some introductory bio, chem, physics, psych, and then assorted advanced neuroscience courses, but it's dependent on the style of the degree and what you want to focus on.
