We'd like for the different NTX chapters to have access to it and do an event to showcase what's new in the field. From "wow" kinda news to scientific breakthroughs, to new kickstarters, to new laws, to major investments, etc.

> 
The goal of the presentation (and the event) is that when you leave, you feel like you have the big picture of what happened lately - without digging too much into the science of it, but staying at a higher level. 

> 
And obviously you'd leave inspired, because the field is awesome :stuck_out_tongue:

> 


> 
1) Do you know any review already online that could be useful?

> 
2) What would you put in that review/presentation? (what for you, is worth mentioning that happened in 2016)

> 
3) If you'd like to help with the content and/or the presentation, please PM me :slightly_smiling_face:

> 
Feel free to throw anything that comes to mind!

(obviously the presentation will be accessible/shared)

 >Hi there! My name is Alaina Finley and I am currently an undergrad student pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Utah. This past summer I worked as an intern for Push the World in NYC ( aj ) I definitively want to go into the NeuroTech industry as neuroscience is my passion, however with the courses Im taking in CS, Im only exposed to neuroscience via independently reading research papers. (Im going into CS so I can eventually go into neurotech..and Im really feeling disconnected to the field) My school offers a create your own degree program that I know many kids have gone through and have had success, and I was thinking of switching and doing an Applied Neuroscience degree with an emphasis in computing. I was wondering if anyone has any input in making this move? And any advice (especially to courses youd recommend I take)?

 >alainafinley: Hey alainafinley  The answer to your question will depend on what your interests are and what you want to specialize in. Neurotech is a multi disciplinary field and you can contribute to it in a variety of different ways. If you want to do research, ask yourself what element of Neuroscience you would like to get involved in. In the meantime, I'd suggest looking at some Neuroscience Moocs to compliment your CS studies and take a look at these resources: <https://github.com/NeuroTechX/awesome-bci> The one which may interest you the most is the analyzing neural time series book. I'd also suggest talking to dano  and see about contributing to the <#C0K883P71|interactive-tutorial>  project <https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/analyzing-neural-time-series-data>

Usually starts off with some introductory bio, chem, physics, psych, and then assorted advanced neuroscience courses, but it's dependent on the style of the degree and what you want to focus on.

Or non-invasive technology like EMG reading muscle activity allowing you to send commands to control 'something'.

3/29/2017 2:45 PM

 **karchie** :

 >there's risk in unsupported hype. around neurotech (interpreting the term very broadly), there are relatively easy problems (stimulating/reading anything peripheral) and moderately easy problems (deep brain stimulation), and then there's anything involving neocortex. with pyramidal cells, there's almost certainly semantic content not just to the coarse location and intensity of stimulation, but to the fine location (certainly apical vs. basal dendrites, maybe even at the level of individual branches) and the fine temporal structure; and these details will vary from one cell to the next. I've been hearing about cortical prosthetic modules (for a particularly egregious example) for 20 years; but if that's going to work at all, I think at best there's a period of months while the nearby neurons learn how to interface with this chunk of new stuff. That's without even getting into the biochemical problems like controlling inflammation and infection and creating a local chemical environment to promote plasticity. I mean, yes, march on with the rats, but I'll bet a nickel against any sort of cognitive upgrades in my lifetime. (sensory upgrades, sure, but noninvasive approaches work pretty well there.)

_"So its important to keep all of these considerations in mind when discussing Neuralink, Kernel, and the scores of brain-computer interface companies that will undoubtedly sprout up in their wake. Its fun to talk about fighting Skynet or preventing The Matrix, but Musk and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley do have more realistic concerns and are, at least right now, more open to admitting that the more near-term goal is combating diseases and funding neuroscience research. It doesnt grab headlines quite like combatting the extinction of the human race, but we should all rest easy knowing that were not quite there yet."_

PONG

> 
Theres a pattern thats common in neurotech: 

> 
Some enthusiastic engineers will discover EEG or tDCS, order a kit, and start making random things while caught up in the romance of neurohacking. 

> 


> 
There are a couple of common forms this initial exploration takes:

> 
1) A meditation app." "Well do neurofeedback to show people when theyre in a meditative state, and use that help them meditate more! Then more people will start meditating, and the world will become more conscious."

> 
This is the hello world of neurohacking. A good idea for your own education, but Interaxons Muse is already a highly optimized version of this product. <http://www.choosemuse.com/people-behind-muse/>

> 


> 
1b) A variant: Attention-tracking app. People will wear an EEG at their computers and it will tell them when their focused! 

> 
To  test whether people will actually use this, try offering a friend $20 to wear an EEG headset for six hours per day for one week. 

> 


> 
2) Control X with my brain. A mood-tracking LED shirt, a robot, your Spotify music playlist, a flamethrower, a drone. With motor imagery, you can use the brain as a up-down or left-right switch for any device. I wouldnt say dont do this. I would just say be aware youre doing this for your own education, in the way that freshman CS majors are often given homework to write their own version of Pong. Because of the benefit-intrusiveness tradeoff of consumer EEG headsets, basically no one will walk around with an EEG on their head in order to express their emotions through your cool LED shirt. Heck, most people wont consistently wear a fitness tracking bracelet (from which you can infer mood). (<http://insights.dice.com/2017/02/07/lessons-jawbone-failures/>). 

> 


> 
3) tDCS. "We heard on that one NPR episode that the army uses these to speed up learning. What if we could enhance learning?" Thats what Thync said in their original sales pitch. 

> 


> 
Consider the first generation (2005-2017+) of consumer EEG and tDCS devices. Much of their sales momentum came from the novelty of a brain-reading or a brain-zapping device. After consumers order them, most are not consistently used because they were a wiz-bang gadget to show at a party, or an exciting thing to hack on, rather than consistently solving a problem that people have. 

> 
<http://Foc.us|Foc.us> recently introduced a product line targeted at DIY hackers: <https://www.foc.us/eeg>. Out of all the potential markets they could target, its alarming that brain hacking enthusiast are the largest. 

> 


> 
If consumer neurotech wants to make really useful and commercially successful devices, we need to expand our technological toolkit.

 >stephen I agree with your post. One thing is that a lot of the solutions that you list would involve developing new technology, which is a solid step forward, but a hard problem for hobbyists and student clubs. Developing hardware takes decent funding and continued interest and investment from team members.   

> 


> 
Beyond developing new technology, the other side is taking more advantage of the low-hanging fruit present with the *current technology*. Here are some recommendations for doing that:   

> 
- Read the literature! Scientists have been correlating various biosignals for decades and wrote about many things beyond motor imagery and meditation. A few examples are memory encoding, visual/auditory/sensory perception, emotion valence, various specific cognitive processing, etc.  It will also give you a sense of what the current limits of the field are. If scientists can't get motor imagery to work reliably (&gt;95% accuracy, which is roughly what would be needed for using an input device with low frustration) with 32 electrodes, then what's the chance of getting it to work with 4-8 electrodes? 

> 
- explore other avenues besides quantified self: things like diagnosis, drug detection, lie detection, "real" attention tracking for optimizing content, which involve using a device for a relatively short period of time, have been relatively underexplored in Neurotech, but are some of the areas where it has the most potential with the current tools

 **pierre** :

 >As an addendum to "read the literature", you can get a lot of mileage when getting started from replicating scientific papers using biosignals to measure the effect you're curious about.

4/3/2017 5:38 PM

 **pierre** :

 >Also, I think the current barrier to entry to all of this is that people don't know how to start recording &amp; processing biosignals, and don't have a good sense of the whole field. <#C3525BTBN|neurotechedu> should help out with both of these problems

4/3/2017 6:39 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >The eeg 101 app that dano and team  have created, allows for storing of datasets. You can take a look at at. What I'm personally motivated to see is a framework/sandbox to use the muse with VR. It's a pretty good form factor for it (Not perfect though. VR glasses and the Muse fit well on my head. It may not on others). I'd also love to see some open source algorithms for different mental states.

4/3/2017 6:41 PM

 **maxim** :

 >Yeah, I saw that eeg-101 is starting to store data now, although I'm interested in storing raw data and not a processed CSV, don't want to potentially miss out on some signal (although that might be my lack of BCI knowledge). Storing data doesn't seem that hard anyway, Muse's own demo app does it, so it is literally just extending it to allow you to save it in different files.

4/3/2017 6:42 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I believe they store all date in the CSV. It's just a different filetype. dano  Can answer this better than I can though.

4/3/2017 6:42 PM

 **maxim** :

 >VR is potentially an interesting application, but even harder to find people to do it it seems. I don't have a VR headset, so there is no way for me to debug it and I bet an intersection of people that have both VR and Muse is pretty small. Mental state detection is something that seems more interesting personally.

4/3/2017 6:44 PM

 **maxim** :

 >That's fine, storing data is one of the first trivial steps, so no harm in redoing it to get used to working with Muse SDK. I'm thinking of also storing a bunch of stuff that's also available from a general phone (mic for noise level and light sensor maybe?) to have more variables to correlate with later on

this does not solve any of the problem this technology has (1- we don't know what we measure 2- the signal to noise ratio is worse than any other non-invasive tech, including EEG)

4/20/2017 1:01 PM

 **yannick** :

 >When you say the signal to noise ratio is worse, do you think its a mathematical problem (optimization / stochastic problem) or hardware related or physics related (i.e. there is just no perfect wavelength for what were targeting)?

4/20/2017 1:14 PM

 **alexandre.barachant** :

 >The few papers showing that we can record fast brain activity with FOS are based on ERP type of analysis. It require average of hundreds of stimulation to show a response. Thats a good starting point, but for a BCI type of application, you need a clear signal on the single trial level. What i'm saying is that okay, the spatial resolution is better, but you need to improve the tech by a factor 100 to actually get something that will allow operation in real time.

> 
Using quasi-balistic light is just an oversimplistic response to a very tricky problem. This will just allow to focus a bit better the beam (increasing the spatial resolution) but does not solve the SNR problem.

> 


> 
The way i understand thing is that FOS works by measuring change in optical properties of neurons when they are activated. So you have to send a beam of light in the right place, it get diffracted by the population of neurons firing and somehow has to come back to the sensor. there is a lot of loss in the process. IMO limitation are physical and hardware related.

4/24/2017 12:44 PM

 **alexandre.barachant** :

 >jmhorschig Very interesting. Did you tried to replicates results from the few FOS papers there exist ?

> 
If it's not FOS they are pursuing, then What ? speech decoding (at least at 100 WPM) can not be achieved just with the BOLD response ...

4/24/2017 12:45 PM

 **alexandre.barachant** :

 >actually, it's clear from one of their slide that they are not going for the Bold response

4/24/2017 1:38 PM

 **jmhorschig** :

 >If they really want to go for 100words/minutes, they have to go for FOS/EROS, hemodynamic responses would be too sluggish and convoluted- I just think it does not work. We tried to replicate such work (I work for Artinis, a NIRS company), and my boss and his former colleagues from academy tried so as well. None had success (and that includes top NIRS researchers which are still active in the field). It happens to be that just approximately one group is recording FOS and publishing about this. Some more groups are coming up now, but it is really not something that you just do along the way. Also, the current record with BCI is around 120bits/minutes (EEG+SSVEP). That is extremely far off from 100 words/minutes.

> 
I think what they might be hoping for is that quasi-balistics photon theory, maybe indeed in combination with what Mary-Lou Jespen is developing, can be combined and constitute a paradigm shift. I am very critical on this though.

4/24/2017 4:13 PM

 **alexandre.barachant** :

 >Thanks for the detailed answer. FOS was bugging me a lot because as you said, only one group is publishing about it. it's been more than a decade and i did not see a clear replication so far. You are confirming my hunch. 

> 
The work of ary-Lou Jepsen seems very interesting and promizing, but to me it's more about anatomy than function.  Everything based on BOLD response will never provide the temporal resolution to capture enough information to decode speech (i might be wrong ...).

> 
IMO, for real time speech decoding, you need a high spatial resolution and be able to tap into the gamma activity. The best way to achieve this non invasive is with MEG ... perhaps in 10 years.

4/24/2017 5:47 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >So perhaps working with an eeg database first?

4/24/2017 5:49 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I guess an approach you could use to bring you up to speed, is first trying to do some analysis on different brain activities (ie eeg paradigms), learn some of the machine learning methods to classify mental states, and then building a "translation" layer which takes different mentals stales and ties it to a computer input.

4/24/2017 7:59 PM

 **amilenkovic** :

 >Hi Vitruvia, maybe I can provide some input as well. You can use an EEG as a method of providing  inputs to a device. The way it typically works is that you use an EEG device to find the pattern you are looking for. That becomes your input. So when someone thinks of the color blue, you will move the cursor up. When they think of green, you will move the cursor down. You record what their brain looks when thinking of Green. Then you record what their brain looks like thinking of Blue. Then you write a program that says "When the brain waves look  like what I saw when the subject was thinking green, move the cursor up. When it looks like blue, move the cursor down."  The technology is available today and works reasonably well. The limitation is how many things you can reliably distinguish and  match on.

4/24/2017 8:20 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I'd suggest talking to the iMotions people. They have a multi-modal bio input system for that type of analysis

 **vitruvia** :

 >amilenkovic Thanks! That is how I thought it might work, glad to see I wasn't so off the mark. What you said is also in line with what sydneyneurotechx suggested, so I guess learning how to analyze and translate brain activity would be a good start

 **amilenkovic** :

 >So it just depends on how fancy of a setup :)

4/24/2017 10:30 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >First off take a look at the awesome-bci list if you haven't <https://github.com/NeuroTechX/awesome-bci>

> 


> 
In terms of databases, You can look at SCCN's list: <https://sccn.ucsd.edu/~arno/fam2data/publicly_available_EEG_data.html>

> 


> 
You can analyze that data in Matlab or Python. If you want to try Python, I'd suggest using the MNE library.  <https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html>

> 


> 
The thing you need to understand before moving forward is that working with eeg and learning to code is something which takes some time to do it properly. Give yourself enough time and be patient. You may need to build some foundational knowledge before you get into the advanced stuff.  Depending on your speed, it may take some time (This is part of the reason why many people get frustrated and stop) I'd suggest finding a friend to do this with (or perhaps someone in this slack). In some cases, this can be a semester long project, so be patient and have fun with it :slightly_smiling_face:

 >It's very hard with MEG (colleagues of mine did that, see <http://www.mpi.nl/departments/neurobiology-of-language/projects/mous-mother-of-all-unification-studies>). Not sure if gamma is sufficient. I think what FB wants is to use NIRS and hope for a combination of "electrophysiological" signals using FOS and hemodynamic responses, thereby getting the best of both worlds. What might work is some combination of an error-signal and auto-write based on previous conversations and the current conversation.  So, something similar to this: <http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/21/10805398/friends-neural-network-scripts> and then detecting if the predicted/suggested phrasing is what the user intends to say. When writing about this, yes, I think this is what they plan to do. It's the only thing that is probably possible and fits with the knowledge and experience FB already has. And it might work up to a certain extent. Users will probably be like "nah, I didn't want to write exactly that, but something along these lines, so ok. Send!". But that'll be more the deep NN doing the work being individualized by having analyzed previous conversations. What do you think?

 ><!channel>  I would to announce NeuroTechX's  new initiative, the "Mother of all BCI Benchmark" project. 

> 


> 
The Goal of this project is to build a comprehensive benchmark of popular BCI algorithms applied on an extensive list of freely available EEG dataset. The code will be made available on github, serving as a reference point for the future algorithmic developments. Algorithms can be ranked and promoted on a website, providing a clear picture of the different solutions available in the field.

> 


> 
Reproducible Research in BCI has a long way to go. While many BCI datasets are made freely available, researchers do not publish code, and reproducing results required to benchmark new algorithms turns out to be more tricky than it should be. Performances can be significantly impacted by parameters of the preprocessing steps, toolboxes used and implementation tricks that are almost never reported in the literature. As a results, there is no comprehensive benchmark of BCI algorithm, and newcomers are spending a tremendous amount of time browsing literature to find out what algorithm works best and on which dataset.

> 


> 


> 
alexandre.barachant will lead the initiative and I will provide logistic support to push it forward. This will be mostly a coding project (It will be open source, so anyone can contribute), however people with a design background are invited as well.

>

I am studying for a master in software engineering and no academic background in neuroscience. While I will use online resource  a to learn (and neurotechedu!) I would love to do some course/summer school.. this is the only one I found so far in Europe (with not too high requirements). Thanks!

 >hi everybody, not sure where to post (as usual :smile: ). So, I am studying for a Msc in Software Engineering and it's time for my thesis. I would really love to do something related to BCI, as I have a great passion to learn more in the field. I have no academic background in neuroscience nor similar, I am not that strong at machine learning etc etc. We have a couple of thesis advisors which work on artificial intelligence and might be interested. The problem is that I have to submit an idea paper, and I am not sure where to start and what I could do!

So basically I was looking if you had any suggestions on where to take hints, ideas in which direction to move. I have a Muse headset and I was thinking to do something with that. But again, I don't have enough experience to understand if I could do something useful for a thesis!

6/6/2017 10:16 PM

 **dano** :

 >francescacoo, I think one of the coolest things in the field rn is the possibility that machine learning could boost the efficacy of affordable consumer EEG to the point where it can provide such good benefits that people can't ignore it. IMU, what ML can do a really good job of in EEG is identify features and tailor itself to a user's particular brain. Because applying ML is relatively simple nowadays, I think figuring out whether that'll work at scale is really a software engineering question.

 >hi endoxaneuro well they would definitely get a better "review" if they didn't make it sound like the military, Olympics, NBA, MLB, and NFL sports "medicine" people know what the hell they are doing and that this has been shown effective to people who should care. If I am wrong about that please post some links to peer-reviewed research articles etc. that I definitely missed. Even with those, and I take it they exist, check the reproducibility problem in neuroscience. Yes I understand the principle they are using. In a way, its kind of the opposite of sewing monkey's fingers together. Not exactly, but I am going to stick with that image. That the military can actually waste money on technology that doesn't work is really just common sense. Hope that helps

This looks like nice way do deliver stimuli for tactile BCIs and stuff like that.

 **yrenard** :

 >rgbn I have tried Ultrahaptics in the past, it's outstanding piece of technology, but I would not recommend using it for tactile BCI based on my past experience on such BCI. Ultrahaptics gives you a sense of where in space the surface is located, but it certainly would not generate a brain response that compares to a vibrotactile stimulator because the stimulation would be much weaker. Did you have a chance to try some of their demo to get a taste of how that feels ?

7/17/2017 6:54 AM

 **jmhorschig** :

 >francescacoo roughly speaking, yes. Alpha is higher though when being tired, so it's a bit questionable whether it's relaxation - the currently predominant hypothesis is that alpha represents inhibition of task irrelevant regions. That means, if you relax and do not require a certain brain region for that, you see an increase in alpha oscillations.

7/17/2017 9:20 AM

 **jonas.chatel-goldman** :

 >@ francescacoo:

> 
It really depends on how you define « relaxation » and « light mediation ». Tons of specific mediation practices exist that recruit different brain processes, its a bit like if we were discussing of a « light sport » activity without clarifying the type of exercice.

> 


> 
If you think of relaxation as simply having a low cognitive charge, then you may expect higher central-parietal alpha (e.g., Pz) and lower central-frontal delta-theta (e.g., Fz). This theta Fz/alpha Pz is a common ratio (e.g., _Holm, A., Lukander, K., Korpela, J., Sallinen, M., &amp; Müller, K. M. (2009). Estimating brain load from the EEG. The Scientific World Journal, 9, 639-651.)_

> 
Also, if you associate relaxation to a state with decreased vigilance (somewhat contradicts the « light meditation ») you may expect an increase in global alpha and in central frontal theta band (related to diurnal sleepiness and first stage of sleep).

> 
_Strijkstra, A. M., Beersma, D. G., Drayer, B., Halbesma, N., &amp; Daan, S. (2003). Subjective sleepiness correlates negatively with global alpha (812 Hz) and positively with central frontal theta (48 Hz) frequencies in the human resting awake electroencephalogram. Neuroscience letters, 340(1), 17-20._

7/17/2017 9:31 AM

 **francescacoo** :

 >Hi Jonas, thanks a lot.

> 
I do understand that the reality is more complex than I thought.

> 
From reading simple resources it looked like alpha were a good predictor for "relaxation".

> 
My "goal" would be to try and determine (without any goal of making a new scientific discovery), which relaxation technique would be more helpful between few (let's say a breath guided meditation, relaxing music, body-scan meditation and so on - for people not expert in meditation I mean). 

> 
This is project for a software engineering thesis, so again, not trying to demonstrate anything or to create a commercial product, but more to explore and experiment classification algorithms and analysis of data.

> 
I am aware that even commercial applications (as for example Muse), might use more complex analysis. 

> 
If I call it "relaxation" more than meditation do you think it could be more appropriate?

I will go and read some more on the topic, but any suggestion is absolutely welcome!

 >Hey everyone! Is anyone attending SIGGRAPH by any chance? My company, Neurable, will be showing/demoing our BCI publicly for the first time. Would love for any of you to come by and try it!

 >adamm_neurable : That's great. Out of curiosity, what EEG device are you using ?

 >SIGGRAPH is a great conference adamm_neurable , you'll have a lot of people flowing around, it is very crowded ! congrats for being part of the event :slightly_smiling_face:

 **mhough** :

 >adamm_neurable yrenard yeah siggraph is a hard core event where math is the product just as much as with cryptography. I'm planning to be there but it's right before ICON in Amsterdam.

 >is there any relative inexpensive technology that can be used to give a meaningful measure of executive function?

7/25/2017 6:20 PM

 **lai_london** :

 >just asking so I can learn more

7/25/2017 6:22 PM

 **benbrain** :

 >lai_london what do you mean by 'measure of executive function'?

7/25/2017 6:28 PM

 **lai_london** :

 >I feel like I will probably end up conflating several more basic processes, but when I mean in everyday terms, is like attention or cognitive efficiency?

7/25/2017 6:29 PM

 **lai_london** :

 >I know thats very vague, I was wondering if someone here could shed more light on this for me. e.g like depending on your mood at different times of the day you are more efficient at cognitive tasks,

7/25/2017 6:29 PM

 **lai_london** :

 >I just wanted to know if there was anything that could measure that in some meaningful way.

7/25/2017 6:30 PM

 **lai_london** :

 >I have heard about muse, but im still educating myself about the underlying technologies

7/25/2017 6:37 PM

 **benbrain** :

 >lai_london EEG technology (like the Muse) is probably your best bet. However, you'll be measuring *correlates* of things like attention and cognitive load and not directly measuring those processes (presently we really have no clear idea of what "measuring" cognitive capacities would entail). There is a whole bunch of research that aims to identify EEG correlates of these types of things, so once you understand how EEG works and what it is measuring, you should start to dig into the nuances of that space.

 >thanks

 **lai_london** :

 >really appreciate your answer

7/25/2017 6:38 PM

 **dano** :

 >In the <#C4LSDAE95|neurodoro> project, we're working on throwing together an open source classifier for attention and cognitive performance with Muse and TensorFlow. You might be interested in that.
