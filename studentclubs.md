 ><!channel> We need help!

> 
The Student Clubs committee is looking for someone to help us develop a website for the Student Clubs initiative. The website will be cool and good-looking, including lots of ressources for new, future and established student clubs, obviously open-source, and probably developed using Jekyll (or similar framework) on GitHub. If you know someone that would be interested in helping us, please contact me (<mailto:benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com|benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com>).

 >Hi Sabrina, My company - Neuro Device is very open to support a students. We provide stimulators for fMRI (tactile and olfactometer), but very soon we will announce two new products - transcranial electro stimulator (with much more modulations as are offered currently) and GSR/Pulse wearable bracelet. If you are interested in, please send me direct message. We have also our lab, where you can use EEGs, eyetrackers, face-recording, psychophysiology apparatus. Unfortunately lab is located in Warsaw, Poland...

 >Beautiful NTX people, quick question: If you were budgeting a webpage for a student club (nothing too fancy, nothing too big)... How much money would you allocate to this?

3/23/2017 6:27 PM

 **yannick** :

 >You shouldn't pay for it, students should do it. The easiest way is to fork the NeuroTechUofT one on GitHub (Jekyll based). Indiana University is currently doing their website as well based on that approach. We'd like to make a "Template out of it". Thumbs up to NeuroTechUofT! Now we can copy their website and improve on it and provide a nice template to new student clubs!

but yeah you definitely don't need to pay for it; we just recruited students who were interested in learning web development and gave them an awesome project to work on :smile:

3/24/2017 12:42 AM

 **benjamindeleener** :

 >sayan_faraz yannick indeed this channel is a little bit more used that a whole studentclubs slack domain. And I guess it is enough for small conversations during the year. Although, we could keep the studentclubs domain for the competition, or create a specific channel on this one.

 **braden** :

 >I was planning on getting a website together this weekend, so perhaps it would be more efficient to start something on wordpress since Im more familiar? Im willing to help with this process, hectordomorozco.

3/24/2017 5:42 AM

 **braden** :

 >any thoughts? yannick benjamindeleener

3/24/2017 5:45 AM

 **braden** :

 >Also just as a quick update on the status of moving parts here at IU, so far Ive found 4 other students that want to be engaged with neurotech.

3/24/2017 5:51 AM

 **braden** :

 >I also met with the hacker squad within our psych department today, theyre going to let me use a mini race track controlled by neurosky as a tangible promotional example rather than trying to inspire others through only a slide deck

3/24/2017 5:52 AM

 **braden** :

 >Any suggestions on getting faculty support though?

3/24/2017 5:54 AM

 **braden** :

 >I met with the psych departments director of outreach today, and he thought it might be difficult to get most of our professors to understand the value in what were trying to do

3/24/2017 5:55 AM

 **braden** :

 >My first thought was to make some sort of video or podcast portraying testimonials from undergrads or professors from other universities

3/24/2017 5:55 AM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >braden our approach so far has been not to approach faculty until we have something that they can contribute to; or else they end up sitting around not really knowing how to contribute

> 
but on the other hand they can really give helpful tips that would save lots of time and worrying

3/24/2017 5:57 AM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >but again a lot of this is 'trial and error' like in startups, so not completely sure if our approach has been a good one :stuck_out_tongue:

> 
i'll definitely say it has its pros and cons

3/24/2017 5:57 AM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >we've tried asking grad students and postdocs instead; one of them really saved us with a few projects

3/24/2017 6:05 AM

 **braden** :

 >yes that makes complete sense. I have some experience working with an awesome faculty member whose support would be super helpful, but its been a couple days with no response. Im sure it would be helpful if we were able to show him that were serious through some tangible project we did

3/24/2017 6:07 AM

 **braden** :

 >good to hear that youve found grad/post doc support though, that is definitely part of my plans for next week. I have a list of EEG Labs Im going to visit next week with hopes of finding a mentor of sorts

3/24/2017 6:08 AM

 **braden** :

 >it would be great to talk to you about your past experiences with this whole process sometime, would you be willing sayan_faraz?

3/24/2017 6:11 AM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >braden yeah ofc :smile:

> 
but i def want to stress that our way might not be the best, and other groups have probably had more success with their ways of doing things

> 
speaking of which yannick benjamindeleener should we have a meeting to discuss our approaches in running our clubs? would be an awesome way of learning from each other :stuck_out_tongue:

3/24/2017 6:18 AM

 **braden** :

 >yesss point taken. the curriculum Im currently in is strictly group projects, which has definitely shown me all varieties of successful and disastrous team dynamics. :slightly_smiling_face::upside_down_face:

3/24/2017 6:21 AM

 **braden** :

 >I do hope to connect and collaborate with student groups from other universities though, tons of value through those relationships!!

3/24/2017 6:27 AM

 **braden** :

 >If youd like to meet, heres my availability for the next week, let me know when would work best for you! <https://www.when2meet.com/?6111623-GHMGY>

3/24/2017 6:31 AM

 **braden** :

 >not sure youve used when2meet, but if yannick or benjamindeleener would like to join in, we could all fill out our availabilities through that link to figure out the best time  to meet as a group

3/24/2017 11:24 AM

 **benjamindeleener** :

 >braden Of course you can create your website with the template you prefer. Wordpress is a great one and very easy to update with news.

> 
Thats amazing you already found a few students interested! I agree that keeping the momentum with the students you have is very important, probably more than getting more people involved. Trying to create a small group that is very passionated and willing to help is key and the rest will follow.

3/24/2017 11:30 AM

 **benjamindeleener** :

 >Concerning faculty support, I agree that it can be difficult to get them involved. However, your student clubs is first a way of learning, by project and with the help of other clubs around the world, and faculty members are very sensitive to the learning aspect. Try to expose them to this, as well as showing how getting students closer to the technology will help them increase to students potential for graduate studies (faculty members are always looking for good graduate students). Dont try to involve too much faculty members, except if you have specific requirements from the university, because they are usually very busy. However, they can give you great advice, and sometimes access to technologies.

3/24/2017 11:31 AM

 **benjamindeleener** :

 >Building a video with students experience is a amazing idea!

3/24/2017 11:33 AM

 **benjamindeleener** :

 >And as Sayan said, if not professor gives you support, try getting in touch with graduate students. They will provide you with advices, help you getting started, and maybe sometimes convince their supervisor to get involved (I cite the example of PolyCortex, at Polytechnique Montreal, which had a few graduate students that helped at the very beginning).

3/24/2017 11:42 AM

 **benjamindeleener** :

 >I would be happy to do a meeting discussing with you some point about running a club and the directions you could take. Ill update my availabilities on when2meet.

3/24/2017 11:49 AM

 **benjamindeleener** :

 >and we will try to get more student clubs in this call

3/24/2017 12:07 PM

 **yannick** :

 >Damn I need to stop going to bed before 2am, that's when the convos are happening!

> 


> 
1) I'd like to know if McGill people have any insights on how they approached support from Faculty and/or Grad Students. /CC sonia, abhishek

> 
2) At ETS, with SynapsETS (CC jp.portant.etsmtl, nicomaque.jette), the strategy was to approach Profs working with EEG (&amp; MEG), because they would understand the value of "hacking" on EEG devices during undergrad years and develop skills on electrophys, cog sci, machine learning, signal processing, etc.

> 
Don't try to involve them necessarily at the beginning, but get their "support" as it can unlock doors down the road (the more senior and/or decorated the Prof, the more weight (s)he can have). Don't try to have them "do stuff" at the beginning or being actively involved, that will come once you have some momentum. Meet them, explain the idea and you'll see you will be your allies and help you a lot and the others at least will know that you exist and can redirect people your way.

> 
The first pain point for researchers / research labs that NTX student clubs can help with, is to speed up the "hands on" learning curve. Neurotech-related fields are multidisciplinary and you now require lots of skills to be efficient and researchers start to see that more than ever before. (e.g. Grad students with little experience in programming when starting their master/PhD) The second pain point is recruitment, finding (good) candidates to join their lab. Such a student club can help in that regard.

> 
3) *Grad Students* can be key. They might have limited time, but their knowledge makes every minute they give to the club very valuable! Lots of them, working in related fields wish that such clubs existed when they where undergrads themselves and will see the value and will want to help (benjamindeleener &amp; I would be good examples I guess, both PhD students)

> 


> 
Hope that helps!

> 


> 
(we'll try to summarize all that feedback (&amp; insights) in the documentation as it might help many student clubs. Thanks braden &amp; sayan_faraz for starting the conversation! :slightly_smiling_face:

3/24/2017 12:16 PM

 **yannick** :

 >PS: No approach is the 100% best as the situation &amp; university &amp; ecosystem &amp; people will be different from one student club to another. And because it all started last year, we're still all learning what works and help and what doesn't. The best thing we can do is exactly what you guys are doing and share experiences and build from one another. (my two cents)

3/24/2017 1:12 PM

 **hectordomorozco** :

 >Thanks everyone for the tips and tricks. I am not paying for it; the reason Im asking for a price is because my undergrads are applying for club status at Mac, so McMaster is paying for it. They need to hand in a yearly budget and they asked me how much should they allocate (from the money that mcmaster is potentially giving them) to the building of a website. 

> 


> 
braden, the way weve been doing it around here is that I actually have been getting on board more people from the health sciences and engineering departments than they psych ones. Usually psych people are not interested in this kind of projects (sadly).
