 >using error potentials for external control is a really cool BCI paradigm. like alexandre mentioned, one paradigm is that the BCI guesses randomly, and then the error potential acts as a "critic" of the BCI's.  things get really interesting when the BCI uses a learning paradigm, like reinforcement learning / q-learning, to start to figure out which state-action pairs cause error, and eventually converges to adopt the state-action sequence that minimizes these evoked error potentials.

Just because something is an ethical issue does not make ethics black and white. Maybe you have a different definition of ethical issue than I do - for me it means that something that needs to be discussed and pro and cons need be weighed up thoroughly and discussing the consequences before going through with it, not just doing it because it might work and sounds like a good idea.

 **mhough** :

 >sid_fulminds rgbn alexandre.barachant ok I see you already responded to this. I posted in devices. Can we just have some boilerplate response for all these that we can just point people to. Yeah I think it should have something about how people who buy it will potentially be some of its most vocal advocates and psychologically why. Not just placebo effects but social psychological and other known mechanisms such as lack of proper metrics and economists understanding of human's temporal blinders. With great claims comes the need for overwhelming evidence not scant. These toy sport devices are not my concern really, I think a prototype, if you will:), of what I am talking about are the binaural, audio-visual and somatosensory devices that are WIDELY used in a number of chronic pain disorders, clinical disorders with no recognized effective treatment and actually RECOMMENDED by PTSD/trauma therapists for whatever you want to call their pain. These people are in a risk category for suicide which is you know sometimes fatal. If you follow me on LinkedIn, you can see that following the temporal interference TES device manufacturer around he seems to be quite cozy with such peddlers. Again, not really my focus, my target being the Amen Clinics as respectable medical facilities, but I want to know how best to respond. Electricity is not a new therapy. It has been used as such almost as soon as Galvani made a frog's leg move. Historically it has been used whenever there is a lack of recognized treatment but it is especially known for treating "diagnoses" that were socially or culturally motivated such as shocking women who were infertile or in the case of my grandmother probably because she was talking just a little too much sense.

6/8/2017 9:43 PM

 **sid_fulminds** :

 >mhough thanks for sharing! Although in all honesty, I am not sure I understand your point though. Are you saying that in general there is a need to provide hard evidence to healthcare claims that are often much too lightly substantiated ?

6/8/2017 10:46 PM

 **mhough** :

 >sid_fulminds yes. yes there should be. And not just electrical. I thought that was understood after the Lumosity case. In the cases that are remanded to therapy because no treatment alternatives are available, the same exact rules should apply. That is where the widespread abuse of these treatments takes place in my opinion. Hope that helps

 >Here is a copy of what a device manufacturer would like to say constitutes evidence of claims. It was shared publicly on LinkedIn so I feel comfortable posting this.

His article argues that curing diseases by a "moonshot" is not very effective as there is a fundamental lack of understanding of how diseases work. I feel that a similar story is happening with neurotech "moon shots". IE not enough focus on understanding how the brain works.

 >Good article. At it's core, the issue seems to be that hope and necessity don't directly translate into scientific progress (though they probably help). A lot of people like to point out that the original moon shot worked so well because the space agency recursively broke the problem down into achievable steps that were actually doable (e.g., mercury and gemini projects) before sending our fragile bodies to the moon. I.e., it was a concerted effort to actually follow through on a long-term strategy even in the face of failures/political pressure.

> 


> 
That might be the best path forward for Kernel, neuralink, fb, etc., and it's hard to say if they want to follow that strategy or if they are financially able to (c.f., nation-state != company). Or maybe that strategy worked in the 60s and gives absolutely no bearing in the age of AI and big data... Either way, it's really exciting that we're actually trying.

I am just starting and very new to this exciting world! :slightly_smiling_face:.  I am a programmer but have no electrical abilities :0.  I need to add to the standard Muse electrodes a couple of additional electrodes.

Would someone be interested in doing this and selling me a pair?  The technical documentation of the muse states:"Auxiliary electrodes (enabled via [Settings] &gt; [Show Aux Input]) can be connected on the Muse micro USB connector, by pin 4 on the MU-02 (BlueTooth LE) model."

> 
Quitting your PhD to apply to an ok job, only to get out of your PhD if you feel like you are in an impasse, would not be the best idea in the long run. The field of NeuroTech is just getting started and with major brain initiatives around the world, chances are that opportunities will continue to increase in years / decades to come. Having a PhD might serve you well in that field. (as opposed to CS related fields like Deep Learning for example)

 >That's a little beyond my experience, but I know a couple of the guys from CanberraUAV and i'd highly recommend jumping on their mailing list and asking there. They may not have experience with the exact setup you're using, but a couple of the main devs for ardupilot/mavlink are on there so they should be able to point you in the right direction!

Apparently things like microwaves, Xrays, and electromagnetic pulses have been used before by US and Russia, and may have already lead to some of these sorts of illnesses in the 70s

 >dano I am super interested in this news story

and the media's severe lack of interest in investigating other possible causes than just 'sonic attacks' I mean, they even discuss that a sonic attack is severely unlikely because of the infrastructure required to deploy such an attack would be physically evident in the building/rooms...

> 
I was thinking it might be side-affects of a brain manipulation attack

> 
The major assumption I feel comfortable making is that whatever happened is affecting the brain and CNS of the victims

> 
After that I get all dark and think like a conspiracy theorist

> 
what could cause such symptoms?

> 
Perhaps these victims are displaying side-affects of genetic changes introduced by a virus? Kind of in the same vein as weaponized optogenetics, but instead of making neurons/cells respond to light, they are performing some other specific manipulation. What the outcome/purpose of these 'manipulations' are I cannot really fathom.

> 
I really wish there was greater dialogue in the media for weaponization of genetic modification. If McDonald's can patent a specific gene sequence, why can't a nation-state with moonshot-like capital develop a 'weapon of genetic modification'. Perhaps it's surgical, perhaps it's more like a carpet bombing,
